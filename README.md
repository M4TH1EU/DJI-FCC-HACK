## How do I know if it worked?

Open the DJI Fly app and go to the Transmission tab. Look at the horizontal bar around -90 dBm:

* If it lines up with the 1km mark, your drone is in CE mode.
* If it falls below the 1km mark, your drone is in FCC mode.

*Check the images below for reference.*

| FCC                           | CE                          |
